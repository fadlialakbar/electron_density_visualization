# Electron Probability Density Visualization

This project calculates and visualizes the radial probability density of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom using the Schrödinger equation.

## Description

The radial probability density function describes the likelihood of finding an electron at a certain distance from the nucleus in a hydrogen atom. This project uses the Schrödinger equation to calculate this probability density for the electron in the ground state (n=1, l=0, m=0) and visualizes it using Python.
